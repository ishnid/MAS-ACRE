# MAS-ACRE

ACRE (Agent Conversation Reasoning Engine) is a project designed to furnish agent platforms (and, by extension, the agents themselves) with the facilities necessary for reasoning about conversations. As messages are sent and received, ACRE will match these to conversations (following pre-defined protocols) and generate appropriate beliefs that will allow the developer to manage communication more easily.

To date, ACRE has been integrated with the Agent Factory framework and the ASTRA agent programming language.

This project can be built with [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) by running the command `ant dist`.

The latest compiled versions are:
- [ACRE-Editor-latest](dist/ACRE-Editor-latest.zip): the GUI protocol editor.
- [MAS-ACRE-latest](dist/MAS-ACRE-latest.jar): the JAR file for the ACRE classes.
